## 🌍 What is NDVI Insights?
**NDVI Insights** allows users to query historical satellite-based NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) data using simple natural language. The app processes the query, fetches corresponding NDVI maps for specified timeframes and locations, and visualizes the vegetation gain or loss over time.

## ✨ Features
- 🗺️ Compare NDVI data across years and locations
- 💬 Natural language queries (e.g., "Compare NDVI in Barcelona between 2010 and 2020")
- 📊 Visual map outputs for gain/loss analysis
- 🔎 Track urban green cover trends over time

## 🧠 Tech Stack
- 🛰️ NDVI data from satellite archives
- 🗃️ GeoTIFF/GeoJSON processing
- 🤖 Natural Language Processing (NLP) for time/location extraction
- 🔍 Python + Gradio for interactive UI
- 🗂️ Hosted on Hugging Face Spaces

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Enter your query (e.g., "Show vegetation change in Mumbai from 2015 to 2023").
2. Wait a few seconds while maps load and compare.
3. View vegetation loss or gain visually.

## 🛠️ Future Work
- Add city-based preloaded examples
- Integrate more environmental indicators (LST, land use)
- Enable export of analysis results
